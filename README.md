# Compress_Modulation

A new design for wireless communication with curve fitting and other methods

This implementation can simply run by load the files into MATLAB and run the project_modulation file.
It will try to compress the original curve (T10.dat), modulate it and simulate to send it via a wireless channel.
The most important (and original) design is the curve-fitting method which will represent the large curve as a high order equation by doing gradient descent.

The simulation result shows that this new design can overperform traditional methods like sampling.
